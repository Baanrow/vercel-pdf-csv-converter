# Vercel PDF to CSV Converter

A streamlined Vercel-hosted web application that converts PDF files (optimized for healthcare claims) to structured CSV data. This project demonstrates a modular, efficient, and practical web application for clients.

Demo the UI here: [https://vercel-pdf-excel.vercel.app](https://vercel-pdf-excel.vercel.app)

## Overview

This application provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to upload PDF files containing healthcare claims data and receive a properly formatted CSV file in return. The conversion process extracts and structures data from complex PDF formats into organized, tabular data that can be easily analyzed or imported into other systems.

## Key Features

- **Simple User Interface**: Clean, responsive design that works across devices
- **Specialized Parsing**: Optimized for healthcare claims documents with intelligent data extraction
- **Instant Downloads**: Processed CSV files are immediately available for download
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Technical Implementation

This application is built using:

- **Next.js 15**: For server-side rendering and API routes
- **React 19**: For building the interactive user interface
- **PDF.js**: For efficient PDF parsing capabilities
- **Vercel Deployment**: Optimized for hosting on Vercel's platform

The architecture follows modern best practices with:

- Separation of concerns between UI and data processing
- API-driven architecture with dedicated endpoints
- Efficient file handling and processing
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## Deployment

This application is designed specifically for deployment on Vercel, leveraging their serverless functions for PDF processing without requiring complex server setup or maintenance.
